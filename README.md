## Overview

This code provides implementations of various exact algorithms and mathematical formulations for the **Edge-Weighted Balanced Connected Partition** problem. The objective is to partition a graph into connected components that are balanced (e.g., in size or weight) while minimizing the total cost of cut edges.

## Directory Structure

- **`TIF/`**  
  Contains the full implementation of all methods described in the paper, including different formulations and algorithms.

- **`HeaviestBalancedTree/`**  
  Includes the code used for generating test instances.

## Compilation

The codebase was developed using **Visual Studio C++ 2025**. For Linux-based systems, you can compile the code using **CMake**. Ensure that the following libraries are installed and properly linked:

- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
- [LEMON](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon)
