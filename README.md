# Edge-Weighted Balanced Connected Partitions

This repository contains code based on the following research paper:

**Morteza Davari, Phablo F. S. Moura, and Hande Yaman**  
*Edge-weighted balanced connected partitions: Hardness and formulations*, 2025.  
[arXiv:2504.02421](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02421)

> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This commit corresponds to the version of the code just prior to the initial submission of the paper.

## Overview

The code provides implementations of algorithms and mathematical formulations for solving the **Edge-Weighted Balanced Connected Partition** problem. The problem involves partitioning a graph into connected components that are balanced (in terms of weights or sizes) while minimizing the total cost of cut edges.
